## I want to contribute, but I'm new to Go. Can I still help?

If you're new to Go and don't know where to start, no problem at all! Here are some resources to get you comfortable with the language. 

1. [Learn Go in 12 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8LgvuEBraI&list=PLkhBzgCtGlZuhYXYeHdDTskubM88iK6GJ)
2. [Go by example](https://gobyexample.com/)
