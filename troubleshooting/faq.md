# FAQ

## I want to contribute, but I'm new to Go. Can I still help?

If you're new to Go and don't know where to start, no problem at all! Here are some resources to get you comfortable with the language. 

1. [Learn Go in 12 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8LgvuEBraI&list=PLkhBzgCtGlZuhYXYeHdDTskubM88iK6GJ)
2. [Go by example](https://gobyexample.com/)
3. [Go Buffalo](https://gobuffalo.io/en/docs/overview)

If you're not a software developer but you've got ideas on how to make the end user experience better, we absolutely welcome that feedback as well. Don't hesitate to reach out and open a Github issue!

## Have you had a chance to answer the previous question?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.
