# Welcome to Hikeshi

## Introduction

We're happy to see you're interested in trying out Hikeshi and hope you enjoy your stay. If you've got any questions, feel free to look at our FAQ or if you find an issue, open a Github Issue.

### Why the name "Hikeshi"?

The name comes from the firefighting system established in Japan during the Edo period. Incident response involves a lot of "firefighting" in the sense that you're only called upon when something has gone very wrong. In high stress situations, it's nice to have a simple tool that assists you while you fight those fires.

### The Goal

The primary hope for this application is to create a tool that doesn't get in the way or add to the stress of incident response. It aims to be simple, reliable, and unobtrusive.

### **TLDR**

* No-cluttered UI.
* No noisy in-app notifications.
* Web Hooks allow you to notify in slack.
* Dark mode support by default.
* Designed specifically for incident response.

It isn't feature packed, but it does exactly what it needs to while you take care of the incidents at hand.
